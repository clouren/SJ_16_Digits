# SJ_16_Digits
A set of double precision matrices printed to 16 digits for conversion to integer
as described and tested on  in the paper
"Algorithm 1XXX: SPEX Left LU, Exactly Solving Sparse Linear Systems 
 via a Sparse Left-Looking Integer-Preserving LU Factorization"

If you want to use these matrices please cite Foster and Davis:
"Algorithm 933: Reliable Calculation of Numerical Rank, Null Space Bases, 
 Pseudoinverse Solutions, and BasicSolutions Using SuitesparseQR"
 
 Moreoever, to find the matrices in their native format,
